# background

Im Vedaant, an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, with a dual degree in electrical engineering and computer science, mainly focusing on low level hardware and semiconductors. 

I'm also a part of WISNED, or the Wisconsin Nano Engineering Device Laboratory, a research group focused on materials-level device charecterization and fabrication. 
Working in WISNED gave me a decent bit of experience working on equipment and techniques in semiconductor fabrication and charecterization, namely using tools like the MJB mask alligner, spin coater, reactive ion etcher, profilometer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Really cool stuff. 

I also generally have an interest in this kind of low level hardware. This really took off after I watched a video about how insane the engineering behind the F-14 tomcats flight computer was, with the tech being used being at least a decade ahead of what was commercially available at that time. 

I didnt fully grasp how difficult this was, so I initially had lofty goals of recreating the original flight-computers on chips using modern methods and technology, mainly stuff like the 16-bit wide memory or dedicated hardware for division and mulitplication of inputs. 

After doing some more courses and getting a better grasp of computer architecture, I realized this was WAY out of my reach, but the idea of being able to fabricate custom integrated circuits with a machine that you could 

1) make cheaply; excluding equipment like the spin coater and hot-plate (both of which are either cheap to get or easy to make), the biggest hurdle to home-IC fabrication was having access to the actual lithography machine
1) make accessible; even if you could get some of the equipment off of ebay for cheap, I didnt feel it was "standardized"; you'd probably spend hours fiddling around with some decade old piece of junk to try and get it to work


in addition to this, the youtubers "Sam Zeloof" and "Breaking Taps" really gave me the final push to dive deep into this project. 

Sam's work was nothing short of insane, building a maskless lithography system in his garage and fabricating chips on-par with early intel chips. 

"Breaking Taps" to me at least kinda exemplifies what an engineer should be; specialized knowledge in one area, but still capable of quickly learning and applying ideas in all other fields. He's had projects that span at least 5 different engineering disciplines from aerospace to mechanical to electrical, and so his work inspired me to move fast and break stuff.
